# TempConvert

TempConvert is my first foray into [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a super-fast, precompiled programming language.

Lacking parts are:
- error-checking (very-important)
- Celcius to Farenheit conversion (pretty important)
- negative number input (who cares about the cold, anyways?) (probably still important)
